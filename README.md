# LifeSim
A python program that simulates the lives of cells in order to test various evolutionary and mathematical theories.
Cells can currently breed, hunt, fight with their competitors. Call a generation with generation(x,y,z). x = the number of cells, y = the amount of food generation per round, z = the number of generations. Then you'll want to read_book() and check out RECORD.
